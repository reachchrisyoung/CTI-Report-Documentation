<h2>Bottom Line Up Front (B.L.U.F.)</h2>

<h4>WHAT NOT TO DO</h4>
<br />
DO NOT start a paper by defining the methodology in which I did my analysis or purpose of the workproduct.<br />
<br />
<h4>Example OF WHAT NOT TO DO:</h4>
<br />
	“This paper will look at key influential and rising hackers.  First, this study will attempt to show the possible reasons why these particular hackers are gaining influence.  Following that, the paper will explore all the skills and capabilities of these hackers.  Finally, the paper will conclude with a forecast for which particular hackers will become the senior leaders.”
<br />
<br />
INSTEAD…
	
       <h4>Get right to the point!</h4>

<h4>How do I get right to the point?</h4>
<br />
<br />
	<b>Answer the question that my audience wants to know as the very first thing upfront.</b><br />
 <br />

Just answer the question that the leadership has because they don’t have the time to know all of the methods that I had used. <br />
<br />
	Instead, they simply want to know what the bottom line is.

<h4>What if my audience has additional questions, though?</h4>
<br />
<br />
	Easy – they can ask, and then I can provide the information that they need.

<h4>TIPS on BLUF 1st Paragraph</h4>

- DO NOT exceed 5 sentences. (1 Paragraph at most!)<br />
- State my assessment using estimative language.<br />
- Make it a summary of the key points made throughout the analytical product.<br />
- Briefly try to answer who, what, where, when, why, and how of the particular issue that we’re looking at.<br />
- Then, expand on the information in the analysis sections.<br />
- Provide recommendations.<br />
- PRO TIP: Write the BLUF “Last” when I’m doing my assessment.<br />

<h2>Key Judgments</h2>

These are usually read by Leadership.
<br />
<br />
Therefore…
<br />
<br />
- They “MUST” convey – accurately and succinctly – the analytical findings of the paper.
<br />
<br />
- Key Judgments “SHOULD NOT INCLUDE” information used in the paper, persons consulted during preparation or who I had coordinated with, or analytical methodologies employed.
<br />
<br />
- Basically, Key Judgments convey what a Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst would say, or should say, to a high-level decision-maker if given only two (2) minutes to in which to convey the findings.
<br />
<br />
- Generally should not exceed 10% of the report.
<br />
<br />
- Key Judgments are in bullet format, listed in order of importance.
<br />
<br />
Example of a Key Judgment from a November 2007 National Intelligence Estimate from Iran’s nuclear intention and capabilities, as declassified and released by the Office of The Director of National Intelligence:
<br />
<br />

	“We judge with high confidence that in Fall 2003, Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program; we also assess with moderate-to-high confidence that Tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons.” 

<h2>Source Summary Statement</h2>

Limit to 1 to 2 paragraphs (Preferably one) – and Paragraphs SHOULD NOT EXCEED 5-6 sentences.

Speak to the:
Types of sources I had used
Credibility, reliability, and relevance to the intelligence provided.
Date of information

Additionally, I should have…
Footnotes or End Notes (depending on my particular employer’s preference).
A good idea to know – and/or place – where my intelligence gaps are. 
	(In some reports, intelligence gaps have been seen at the end of the assessment.)

Made up & illustrative example of a Source Summary Statement:

	“Analytical findings are based on multi-source intelligence reporting over the last two years.  SIGINT detailing XYZ threat actor capabilities was corroborated with two long-time HUMINT sources assessed to be reliable and whose reporting on past and different cyber threat actors has been corroborated.  OSINT (pastebin / IRC, dark web chats) often corroborated classified reporting yet we are unable to fully determine the reliability and credibility of those OSINT sources on such platforms.” 

Takeaways:

“Analytical findings are based on… [single or multi-source intel] over [time element].”

“[Intel source one] detailing [threat/threat actor] capabilities [insert how this is credible].”

“[Intel source two] corroborates, yet [be honest on credibility or ability to substantiate reliable intelligence].”

In terms of Intelligence Gaps…

PRO TIP: Write intelligence gaps as statements, not questions.

In these statements, identify:
The specific intelligence gap
Why it is a gap for this assessment
What is needed to fill the gap.

Example of an intelligence gap:

	“This assessment lacks insight into phone and encrypted chat communications.  We consider this a gap in our assessment because understanding communications could provide us with clarity regarding TTP modifications and possible next targets.  Recommend focusing SIGINT collection platforms for this purpose.” 

Takeaways: 

“This assessment lacks…”

“We consider this a gap in our assessment because… [Insert what is needed to fill the gap].”

“Recommend…”


<h2>Threat and Strategic Analysis</h2>

Threat and Strategic Analysis

1 to 2 paragraphs for Threat Analysis
1 to 2 paragraphs for Strategic Analysis
There’s really no hard & fast rule about this.

KEY TAKEAWAY: The shorter, the better.

Analysis should also:
Employ the decreasing importance style; avoid increasing.
Start with the most important parts of the analysis, and work back in order of importance.


Start with the most recent information, then work my way back in the timeline.


Inform about what, if any, analytical methodologies used during the analysis actually aided in forming key judgments.  

Threat Analysis (Technical) - What, How, When, Where of the cyber issue.
1 - to - 2 paragraphs (not a hard & fast rule; the shorter, the better).

Strategic Analysis (Holistic) — Rooted in Threat Analysis yet focuses on Who and Why (when it comes to particular threat actors) or a deep analysis on trends in the industry or a particular topic or technology (such as geopolitics or emerging technology).
1 - to - 2 paragraphs (not a hard & fast rule; the shorter, the better).

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Whether or not a conclusion is written is a judgment call based on the company/organization, and me, my role, my responsibilities, and how much time I actually have.

PRO TIP: In some cases, if I only have a page, or 1.5 pages of text, I probably do not need to write a conclusion.

If I do have a conclusion, ENSURE THE READER WALKS AWAY WITH WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW!

Think of the conclusion as my last chance to convey my meaning to the audience / reader.  Because of that, I really want a strong conclusion.  

Since the consumer of my workproduct has already reached the conclusion – meaning they’ve read through the entire paper by this point – feel free to synthesize my analysis a bit more, with…
More detail…
Or a way that best captures my meaning and what I want my reader to remember and act on at the end. 
So – like the B.L.U.F., the conclusion brings all of the pieces together; BUT, in the conclusion, I have more flexibility to allude to people, places, concepts, attacks, etc., covered earlier in the paper.

PRO TIPS for the Conclusion:

Try to make it unique – meaning, it should flow organically from everything that came before it.


Substantive – it should have meaning, giving the reader something to consider.


Proportional – meaning that the Lens of the Conclusion depends on the length and complexity of the workproduct.  
PRO TIP: The conclusion should not be 3 paragraphs if my paper is 2 paragraphs long.


Consistent - meaning that it should convey the same overall message in the B.L.U.F.; Remember to make the Conclusion consistent to the tone and attitude of the rest of the paper.  NO MIXED MESSAGES!


The conclusion should NOT be a copy & paste of the B.L.U.F.


DO NOT LEAVE ANY CLIFFHANGERS
