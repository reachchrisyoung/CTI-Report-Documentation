<h2>Bottom Line Up Front (B.L.U.F.)</h2>

<h3>WHAT NOT TO DO</h3>
<br />
DO NOT start a paper by defining the methodology in which I did my analysis or purpose of the workproduct.<br />
<br />
<h4>Example OF WHAT NOT TO DO:</h4>
<br />
	“This paper will look at key influential and rising hackers.  First, this study will attempt to show the possible reasons why these particular hackers are gaining influence.  Following that, the paper will explore all the skills and capabilities of these hackers.  Finally, the paper will conclude with a forecast for which particular hackers will become the senior leaders.”
<br />
<br />
INSTEAD…
	
       <h4>Get right to the point!</h4>

<h4>How do I get right to the point?</h4>
<br />
<br />
	<b>Answer the question that my audience wants to know as the very first thing upfront.</b><br />
 <br />

Just answer the question that the leadership has because they don’t have the time to know all of the methods that I had used. <br />
<br />
	Instead, they simply want to know what the bottom line is.

<h4>What if my audience has additional questions, though?</h4>
<br />
<br />
	Easy – they can ask, and then I can provide the information that they need.

<h3>TIPS on BLUF 1st Paragraph</h3>

- DO NOT exceed 5 sentences. (1 Paragraph at most!)<br />
- State my assessment using estimative language.<br />
- Make it a summary of the key points made throughout the analytical product.<br />
- Briefly try to answer who, what, where, when, why, and how of the particular issue that we’re looking at.<br />
- Then, expand on the information in the analysis sections.<br />
- Provide recommendations.<br />
- PRO TIP: Write the BLUF “Last” when I’m doing my assessment.<br />

<h2>Key Judgments</h2>

These are usually read by Leadership.
<br />
<br />
Therefore…
<br />
<br />
- They “MUST” convey – accurately and succinctly – the analytical findings of the paper.
<br />
<br />
- Key Judgments “SHOULD NOT INCLUDE” information used in the paper, persons consulted during preparation or who I had coordinated with, or analytical methodologies employed.
<br />
<br />
- Basically, Key Judgments convey what a Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst would say, or should say, to a high-level decision-maker if given only two (2) minutes to in which to convey the findings.
<br />
<br />
- Generally should not exceed 10% of the report.
<br />
<br />
- Key Judgments are in bullet format, listed in order of importance.
<br />
<br />
Example of a Key Judgment from a November 2007 National Intelligence Estimate from Iran’s nuclear intention and capabilities, as declassified and released by the Office of The Director of National Intelligence:
<br />
<br />

	“We judge with high confidence that in Fall 2003, Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program; we also assess with moderate-to-high confidence that Tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons.”
